- I have deployed the app on Hugging Face Space: https://huggingface.co/spaces/hanhou/patchseq
  - It may take some time for the app to start up. 
  - "Show Raw Sweeps" does NOT work on Hugging Face because the app still looks for NWBs locally rather than from s3.
- To try all the features (or to develop), it is recommended to use [this Code Ocean capsule](https://codeocean.allenneuraldynamics.org/capsule/4985779/tree) and follow [instructions here](https://hanhou.notion.site/Instruction-to-run-patch-seq-Panel-app-1e43ef97e73580ee800ef464a3f0ab77).
